# sys-school

This is the first version of my CRUD application. Thanks to it I learned how to build a simple application that performs functions such as adding records to MySQL database, loading, modifying or deleting them. This project showed me how important it is to named variables, method and class and use the principle of one method-one operation.
Also I understood how works simple desing pattern -> Active Record.
